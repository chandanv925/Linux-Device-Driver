10. **How does the Linux kernel handle interrupts and exceptions?**
    - Interrupts and exceptions are handled by interrupt service routines (ISRs) and exception handlers, respectively. The Linux kernel uses interrupt handlers to handle hardware interrupts and software interrupts (system calls), ensuring timely response and proper error handling.
	
	*Interrupt:*  An interrupt is a signal that temporarily halts the normal execution of a program to service a more urgent event. This event could be from hardware (like a key press) or software (like a system call).

    *Interrupt Handler/ISR:*  This is the code specifically designed to handle that interrupt. When the interrupt occurs, the processor suspends the current program, saves its state, and jumps to the interrupt handler's address. The ISR then addresses the reason for the interrupt and prepares the system to resume the original program.

11. **What is kernel panic? How do you troubleshoot kernel panics?**
    - Kernel panic is a critical error condition in which the Linux kernel cannot continue executing due to a fatal error. To troubleshoot kernel panics, analyze kernel log messages (`dmesg`), review kernel crash dumps (`vmcore`), and use debugging tools like kdump, netdump, or crash.
	Behavior During Kernel Panic:

   *Software Watchdog:* In the case of a kernel panic, the software watchdog might not be able to detect the issue if the kernel itself is frozen or unresponsive. This is a limitation because the watchdog relies on the kernel's functionality to receive the keep-alive signal.
   *Hardware Watchdog:* A hardware watchdog is more reliable during a kernel panic. Since it operates independently, it can still trigger a system reset even if the kernel is unresponsive, offering a better chance of recovery.
